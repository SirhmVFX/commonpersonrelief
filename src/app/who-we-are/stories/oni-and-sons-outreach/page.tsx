            Our next stop was at the Oni and Sons Memorial Hospital. Healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet many people struggle to access even the most basic medical support. At Common Person Relief, we believe that no one should feel alone in their time of need. That‚Äôs why, on January 14, 2025, we extended our hands to the patients of Oni and Sons Memorial Hospital, Ibadan, providing support, encouragement, and essential items.

            Hospitals are places of healing, but they can also be places of uncertainty and distress. Our goal was to remind patients and caregivers alike that they are not alone‚Äîthat there is a community that cares about them.
