                At Common Person Relief, we believe in the power of community-driven impact. Our mission is to extend a helping hand to those in need, bringing not just resources but also hope, encouragement, and a sense of belonging. On January 14, 2025, we had the incredible opportunity to visit Seriko Sabo, a community where many struggle with daily necessities. Our goal was simple: to provide support, spread kindness, and make a lasting impact.

                Seriko Sabo is home to many families who face challenges ranging from food insecurity to limited access to healthcare. We knew that even small efforts could make a big difference, so we organized an outreach program focused on food distribution, health awareness, and emotional support.
