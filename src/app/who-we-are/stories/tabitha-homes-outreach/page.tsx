        Acts of kindness, no matter how small, can change lives. This belief drove our outreach at Tabitha Homes on January 14, 2025, where we joined hands to support vulnerable communities. The experience was one of connection, learning, and transformation‚Äînot just for the beneficiaries but for our team as well.
